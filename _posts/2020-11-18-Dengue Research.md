# **What is Dengue?**

**Dengue viruses are spread to people through the bite of an infected Aedes species(Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus) mosquito. Dengue is common in more than 100 countries around the world. Forty percent of the world’s population, about 3 billion people, live in areas with a risk of dengue. Dengue is often a leading cause of illness in areas with risk**

**Dengue outbreaks are occurring in many countries of the world. Currently, dengue cases are on the rise in the Caribbean.Most dengue infections are asymptomatic; however, when symptomatic, the virus can cause mild dengue fever (DF), or more severe forms of the disease, including dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), or dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Dengue in the Americas has an endemo-epidemic pattern with outbreaks every 3 to 5 years. In 1818, a dengue-like disease outbreak in Peru accounted for ∼50,000 cases.  During the following years epidemics were reported in the Virgin Islands; Puerto Rico (1915); Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (1916); and Corrientes and Entre Rios, Argentina (1916). In 1918 an outbreak was reported in Galveston Texas, followed by another outbreak of larger proportions in 1922 with an estimated 30,000 cases of dengue-like disease.**

# **My project**

**My current project involves a dataset that uses the years from 1990 to 2009 in Iquitos, Peru and San Juan, Puerto Rico. It has the serotypes from 'Denv1' to 'Denv4' based in Peru and Puerto Rico.**[metadata](https://dengueforecasting.noaa.gov/)

**In this graph below it represents the different serotypes from when the week started from April 4TH 1990 to June 6th 2008. You can tell here that the first three serotypes have a wide range of activity but the 'Denv4' serotype seems to have spiked near the 2008 to 2009. You can also see that 'Denv3' cases didnt start activity till about 1998.**
